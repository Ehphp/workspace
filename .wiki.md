# Project Summary
The Brellò Sales & Finance Cockpit is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline sales and financial operations for the Brellò Umbrella Sharing business. It provides tools for monitoring occupancy rates, managing customer relationships, generating quotes, and analyzing financial performance through interactive dashboards and reports.
